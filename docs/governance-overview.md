Governance Overview (Public)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides a high-level public overview of the governance and control model of the JERT Network and its associated on-chain treasury infrastructure.

It is intentionally designed to:

demonstrate institutional-grade governance to sophisticated investors;

explain control, security, and resilience principles;

avoid disclosure of sensitive personal, corporate, or jurisdictional details that could create undue operational or geopolitical risk.

Full legal disclosure is available only under NDA (see Section 6).


2. Governance Architecture (High-Level)

The JERT Network treasury is governed through a multi-signature smart contract deployed on EVM-compatible networks.

Key characteristics:

Threshold model: 2-of-3 signatures required

No single point of control

No unilateral execution capability

On-chain enforcement, not policy-based trust

This structure ensures that material decisions require consensus across independent control domains.


3. Signer Roles (

For security, resilience, and jurisdictional risk mitigation, individual signers are represented by role, not by name or legal entity, in public documentation.

The three signers represent independent control domains:

Signer A – represents a registered local infrastructure operator - CRYOGAS LLC (Kazakhstan), BIN 230140010661.The entity is a party to an investment agreement 
with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and is responsible for physical execution and capital deployment for the first terminal i Actobe.

Signer B – Engenering & technology / Holding Control
Represents strategic and commercial interests of the group, including brand, IP, and long-term value alignment.

Signer C – Independent Strategic / Fiduciary Control
Provides balance, continuity, and risk mitigation across jurisdictions and operating environments.

No single signer can execute treasury actions independently.


4. Security & Resilience Principles

The governance model is designed according to conservative, institutional best practices:

Consensus requirement: minimum 2 independent approvals

Key separation: each signer controls their own private key

Loss tolerance: system remains operational if one signer becomes unavailable

No custodial dependence: treasury is controlled exclusively by on-chain logic

For production environments, signers are required to use:

hardware wallets or equivalent secure key storage;

strict operational key management procedures.



5. Jurisdictional & Geopolitical Risk Management

The governance model deliberately avoids concentration of control in a single:
individual,

legal entity,

jurisdiction,

or regulatory environment.


This design:

reduces exposure to hostile takeovers or coercive pressure;

limits regulatory or political single-point failure;

supports long-term expansion across Europe, Central Asia, and Asia-Pacific markets.


Jurisdictional separation is a core design feature, not an afterthought.

6. Disclosure Policy

Detailed information regarding:

identities of signers,

associated legal entities,

jurisdictions,

internal governance agreements,


is not published publicly.

Such information is disclosed only under NDA to:

regulated EU / US institutional investors;

banks, custodians, and auditors;

competent authorities upon lawful and formal request.


This policy balances transparency for investors with operational and geopolitical security.


---

7. Evolution & Scalability

The governance framework is designed to scale with the project:

additional regions and operating subsidiaries;

expansion into Asian markets;

future regulatory alignment without redesign of core control logic.


Governance parameters may evolve over time through the same multi-signature consensus mechanism described above.


8. Summary

The JERT Network governance model:

aligns with global best practices;

avoids centralized control risks;

protects long-term value creation;

supports cross-border expansion in complex regulatory environments.

This document represents the public layer of governance disclosure.
