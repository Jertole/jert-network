# JERT Network – Full Project Roadmap  
### USD-Denominated, Energy-Referenced Utility Token Infrastructure  
### Status: Active | Updated: 2026-11-13


## Historical Milestone (December 2025) — Direct Send JERT on Sepolia

**Result recorded in December 2025:** MetaMask confirmation followed by on-chain confirmation on Sepolia.
- Environment config stabilized:
  - `.env` contains `VITE_JERT_TOKEN_SEPOLIA` (kept backward-compatible `VITE_JERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS`)
- Resilience improvement:
  - `decimals()` call is not a hard blocker (fallback/try-catch; default 18)
- MetaMask edge-case documented:
  - “Review alert” / missing Confirm can happen with **0 Sepolia ETH** (no gas). Fix: fund wallet with Sepolia ETH.

**Published React flow:** Direct Send JERT requires transaction confirmation in MetaMask. The dashboard shows placeholders for creating, confirming, and executing multisig transactions.

## Canonical Baseline (Status: DONE ✅)
 ✅ Sepolia deployment check: `npx hardhat run scripts/check-deployed-contracts.ts --network sepolia` → `ALL GOOD ✓`

The repository is stabilized under a conservative, stability-first canonical layout.

Completed:
- Root hygiene: README aligned with real folder structure; CONTRIBUTING filled; .editorconfig added; .gitignore hardened
- Root proxy scripts: root package.json added (no workspaces, no Turborepo enabled)
- CI stability: per-package workflows remain green
- Umbrella CI: root umbrella workflow added and validated (installs deps per package; skips missing scripts safely)

Rules going forward:
- Do not break existing green CI checks
- Prefer incremental changes; avoid large refactors
- Turborepo will be introduced only after stable canonical baseline (prepared via turbo.json, not yet enabled)
  ## CI & Turborepo Status (Fixed ✅)

- Umbrella Root CI enabled as the primary orchestration layer
- Turborepo v2 integrated for umbrella only (no workspaces, stability-first)
- Turbo tasks defined via turbo.json (v2 schema)
- Package filtering performed by path (./smart-contracts, ./corporate-wallet)
- Turbo cache enabled (.turbo), npm root cache intentionally disabled
- No root lockfile by design (per-package dependency management preserved)

Result:
- All CI workflows green
- Deterministic, reproducible checks
- Fast re-runs via Turbo cache
- Infrastructure layer considered **stable and closed**

# 📌 Overview

The JERT Network represents a full-stack permissioned EVM ecosystem designed to support

---

## Legend / Status

- ✅ – Completed
- 🟡 – In progress / partial
- ⏳ – Planned
- 🟥 – Blocked / external dependency

---

## Step 1 – Smart Contracts & Tests

**Goal:** have a complete minimal set of contracts and reliable tests.

### 1.1 Core contracts

- ✅ `JERTToken.sol` – capped ERC-20 (1T max supply)
- ✅ `KYCRegistry.sol` – whitelist registry
- ✅ `ComplianceGateway.sol` – read-only compliance gate
- ✅ `LeaseContract.sol` – lease registration + payment tracking
- ✅ `TreasuryMultisig.sol` – multi-signature treasury

### 1.2 Tests (Hardhat, TypeScript)

- ✅ Token cap + mint/burn permissions
- ✅ KYC single + batch updates
- ✅ Compliance pre-checks
- ✅ Lease lifecycle (Register → Active → Completed)
- ✅ Multisig owners, confirmations, execution & failure paths

---

## Step 2 – Corporate Wallet / Multisig React UI

**Goal:** provide an internal dashboard for treasury operations.

- ✅ Contract service layer (`jertContracts.ts`)
- ✅ Standalone multisig dashboard component (outside the main screen):
  - ✅ list owners & required confirmations
  - ✅ show ETH + JERT balances of treasury
  - ✅ load transactions via `getTransactionCount()` + `transactions(i)`
  - ✅ signature progress bar (confirmations / required)
- 🟡 API integration:
  - ⏳ real-time tx feed from API Gateway and/or event logs (WebSocket)

---

## Step 3 – JERT Mobile Wallet (Flutter)

**Planned for a later Flutter update (August 2026 decision)**

- Use the existing JIPP registration and identity flow, with KYC/AML verification through Didit. Flutter Wallet will use the shared JIPP/JDAT session and verification status.
- Require explicit transaction confirmation in an external wallet. Multisig operations are subject to the contract's owner and confirmation rules.

The historical prototype design included in-app key creation, import and signing, a local PIN, balance screens, a receive QR code, and a placeholder transaction history.

---

## Step 4 – API Gateway & Observability

**Goal:** central gateway for:

- wallets,
- corporate tools,
- future explorers,
- and external integrations (Middle Corridor, LNG cold energy, etc.).

### 4.1 API endpoints

- ✅ `GET /api/health` – healthcheck
- ✅ `GET /api/wallet/balance` – ETH + JERT + USD equivalent
- ✅ `GET /api/tx/history` – history stub (empty list for now)
- ✅ `POST /api/oracle/update` – Middle Corridor / LNG oracle endpoint
- ✅ `POST /api/compliance/*` – KYC/AML middleware hooks (stubs)
- 🟡 `POST /api/tx/send` – intentionally disabled (signing must remain client-side)

### 4.2 TODO – real transaction history

- ⏳ Implement log-based history:
  - scan recent blocks for `Transfer` events (JERT),
  - filter by `from` / `to` address,
  - paginate and cache results.
- ⏳ Add dedicated explorer-oriented endpoint:
  - `GET /api/tx/history/jert?address=0x...`
  - supports pagination & direction filters.

---

## Step 5 – Deployment & Networks

**Goal:** run JERT infra on testnet(s) and, later, on production permissioned EVM network.

- ⏳ Define network IDs, chain configs, and RPC nodes for:
  - ⏳ local dev (Hardhat / Anvil),
  - ⏳ internal testnet,
  - ⏳ production permissioned network.
- ⏳ Set up:
  - ⏳ RPC node(s) with basic monitoring,
  - ⏳ JERT explorer (Blockscout / similar),
  - ⏳ CI/CD pipeline for contracts + API + UI.

---

## Step 6 – Security & Compliance

**Goal:** ensure the system is safe enough for real value.

- ⏳ Internal security review:
  - contracts (reentrancy, auth, caps),
  - API Gateway,
  - mobile & web clients (no private key leaks).
- ⏳ External audit (3rd party, once scope stabilises).
- ⏳ Compliance review for AIFC / local regulators:
  - KYC/AML rules,
  - token classification,
  - reporting requirements.

---

## Step 7 – Productization

**Goal:** convert the tech into deployable products.

- ⏳ JERT Corporate Wallet (multisig) v1.0 release
- ⏳ JERT Mobile Wallet v1.0 (Android, then iOS TestFlight)
- ⏳ JERT Explorer (minimal Blockscout or custom-lite)
- ⏳ Documentation pack for regulators / partners:
  - whitepaper + annexes,
  - technical reference,
  - compliance overview.
